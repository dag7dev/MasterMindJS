# MasterMindJS
mastermind adaption in JavaScript

This is a simple adaption in JavaScript, an attempt to recreate MasterMind using HTML DOM, JavaScript and...CSS.
I made this for a school project and the code has been made in 3 hours.
I tried in optimizing the code as much as I could.

I am going to write comments in English, as for now they are in Italian.

If you want to try the game just follow this link:

# HOW TO PLAY
- at the beginning, a random colors sequence is generated.
- you need to guess what this random sequence is. Colors can repeat each other in a sequence.
- you should click on 1 2 3 or 4 to cycle the colors, then click "verify" button
- you could have three possibilities:
  - white box: no colors guessed, no right position
  - gray box: color guessed, no right position
  - black box: color guessed, right position
  
For example:
SEQUENCE GENERATED: red blue green violet
YOUR INPUT:         red yellow orange green
RESULT:
  - 1 black box
  - 1 gray box
  - 2 white boxes
